This pattern is based on a combination of pre-determined data and processing, as if a person wants to travel from one point to another, even on a pathfinding that he does not know, he will find this route with key points, for example, you want to go from Switzerland to Travel to Sweden. It doesn't seem like you want to remember everything. You just need to know which countries you need to cross. Here, the countries become the highest layer of the routing data network.
And this template will only process limited to the same path.
It is possible that each country has its own division and the processing is done in the same way so that the bottom layer is processed with the least.
This case is being implemented in Unreal Engine so that pathfinding can be done faster.
For example, the character can know in his current position which area of the game he is in and then find the general path with the help of that, which requires a more efficient data structure.
I am not sure if this has been raised before, but because of the routing inefficiency in Unreal Engine 5, it has now become my responsibility in the project I am working on. I have started researching and implementing a solution for this issue, and I am still in the process of implementing it. I will provide more details once the work is completed, which should be in about a month.
Pathfinding using multi-layered data points

This method is inspired by the way humans navigate, where they use addresses to go from their current location to another point without focusing on the specific route details and instead relying on key points known as data points.
By using multi-layered data points, the pathfinding algorithm becomes more efficient and faster. This approach allows for quicker route calculations by breaking down the path into simpler components at different levels of abstraction. This not only reduces the computational load but also simplifies the decision-making process for the AI.
In the context of the Unreal Engine, this technique can be particularly beneficial for complex game environments with varying levels of detail. By structuring the data in layers, the pathfinding algorithm can navigate through the game world more effectively, taking into account different obstacles and terrains at each level.
Overall, implementing pathfinding with multi-layered data points can greatly enhance the performance of AI in games, making the gameplay experience more immersive and dynamic. This approach can be a game-changer for developers looking to optimize their pathfinding algorithms and create more sophisticated and lifelike AI behaviors in their games.
This method is derived from human-like routing, in which when he wants to go from the current location to another point, he does this with the help of the address, without paying attention to the details of the route and only based on the key points, which are called Data points
